# Bigger Than Cali

Microsite for getting a quick intuitive sense of the sizes of countries. Try:
* https://biggerthancali.org/canada
* https://smallerthancali.org/australia

If you use the domain name that implies a false comparison - biggerthancali.org for a country that's actually smaller or smallerthancali.org for a country that's actually bigger the text turns red.
Claude Opus 4.5 wrote 99% of the code. Good for him. Such a nice boy.
